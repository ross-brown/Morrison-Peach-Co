# Morrison-Peach-Co
In this project, I used flexbox to design and build the layout for a peach companyâ€™s homepage.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

One of the first websites that I built from scratch using HTML and CSS. Focus was on the effective use of flexbox to organize the contents of the page. 

## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to elevate a page with the use of CSS pseudo classes in the navigation bar. Also learned to make sure the website looks good no matter how the browser window is sized.
